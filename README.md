## 📌 Project Overview

This project is a Machine Learning-based application designed to predict vehicle CO2 emissions (g/km) based on engine specifications.

Developed as part of the **Artificial Intelligence Course**, this project supports **SDG #13: Climate Action** by raising awareness about transportation emissions. The application serves as an **MVP (Minimum Viable Product)** to help users estimate the environmental impact of various vehicle types.

## 🤖 Machine Learning Model

- **Algorithm:** XGBoost Regressor (Extreme Gradient Boosting)
- **Accuracy:** >99% (R2 Score)
- **Key Features:**
  - Predicts CO2 emissions based on Engine Size, Cylinders, Fuel Consumption, and Vehicle Class.
  - Utilizes `LabelEncoder` for categorical data processing.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Language:** Python
- **Framework:** Streamlit (for Web Interface)
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, XGBoost, Joblib
